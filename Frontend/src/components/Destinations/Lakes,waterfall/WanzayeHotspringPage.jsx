          <Typography style={textStyle}>
            The primary draw of Wanzaye is undoubtedly its naturally heated,
            therapeutic waters. Emerging from deep within the Earth, these
            geothermal springs reach temperatures of 42Â°C and above, creating a

            composition of the water, heated by subterranean geological
            activity, is believed by many Ethiopians to possess remarkable
            healing properties. The perception of these waters as "holy" and
            capable of curing various ailments, such as rheumatism and skin
            complaints, reflects a deep-rooted cultural belief in their
            therapeutic efficacy. This traditional understanding, passed down
            through generations, contributes significantly to the allure and
            popularity of Wanzaye as a destination for wellness and
            rejuvenation.

            The Role of the Gumara River

          <Typography style={textStyle}>
            The Gumara River, flowing in close proximity to Wanzaye, adds
            another dimension to the area's appeal. As a significant tributary
            of Lake Tana, it plays a vital role in the regional ecosystem and

            the warm, mineral-rich waters of Wanzaye and the flowing waters of
            the Gumara River creates a unique microenvironment that supports a
            diverse range of flora and fauna. The river also offers
            opportunities for leisurely walks along its banks and further
