        Landforms and Climate
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Due to the exogenic and endogenic forces that have acted for millions of
        years, the landforms of Amhara are made up of river-cut gorges, valleys,
        plateaus, mountains, hills, and plains. The altitude varies from 500m
        around Metema to 4543m above sea level at Ras Dejen in the Semien
        Mountains National parks.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Highlands comprise the largest part of the northern and eastern parts of
        the region. Chains of mountains and plateaus characterize the highlands.
        Mount Ras Dejen (4543m) is the highest peak in the country, Mount
        Analu(4473m), Mount Tefaw Lezer(4449m), Mount Kolo(4300m), Mount Guna
        (4231m), Mount Choke/Birhan (4184m) and Mount Abune Yousef (4284m) are
        among the mountain peaks that are located in the highland parts of the
        region. The lowland part with an altitude between 500-1000 above sea
        level covers mainly the western and some eastern parts of the region.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Due to the altitude and cloud cover effect, there is a spatial variation
        of temperature and rainfall distribution in the region. The annual mean
        temperature for most parts of the region ranges between 15°C-21°C. The
        sunny season prevails from October through May, and the highest rainfall
        occurs during the summer season, which starts in mid-June and ends in
        early September.
